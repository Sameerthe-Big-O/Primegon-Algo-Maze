//*it's exactly the opposite of the queue the latest element becomes the head 

//*often you see error the stack tracer ever wonder what that refers to basically that what was the latest function or most recent function when the error occured 


//*it's just like the book of the stac as well where the last one will get the fist out and last one becomes the lastest  


//*adding the new Element 

//*we'd point the lastest element most recent element let's E is getting then we'd pointing the E to the  and then we'd update head to the E the reason we first point E to head is because we we actually want to create the link 

//*removing   


//*first we'd save the lastest head element  

//*upate head to repoint back to the previous one
//*then you update your head to point to the previous or next to last  depending on how we wanna create  and then can return out E 


//*E will no longer be pointing here we break it here from the greaph, we just do the opposite, inverse

//*whenever we call the function we basically put that on the stack also uses in the recursion


//*property access on the js may not the constant time remember that shit
