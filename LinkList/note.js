//*node as the type of container that will wrap the data 



//*memeory usage is bit more optimized  but there's different run time cost 


//*for the array theb memrory is already being retrived for the usgae in most languages 

//*we couldd create the object pool to hold on the nodes before using as well and optimzed speed of the list but in LinkList we alwayse use the less memory 


//*to get item we've to traverse the list it's like   no binary search on Link 

//*you can't go the backward in singly LinkList 


//*if you don't have reference what's behind you lose it forever 

//*it uses the heap allocated objects and puts them 

//*let's say we want to insert the F at B now what could happen ???

//*F needs to points to the A
