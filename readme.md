This repo is a quick guide for students who want to revise the data structures and algorithms(for junior roles).

This repo contains all the most common concepts you might encounter (fun fact:Dijkstra's algorithm isn't difficult as you thinks)

Currently, I'm working on this repo if you see this repo empty then probably I'm learning these topics myself
