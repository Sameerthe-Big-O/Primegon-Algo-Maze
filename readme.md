This repo is a quick guide for students who want to revise the data structures and algorithms(for junior roles) by Fav pm.

This repo contains all the most common concepts you might encounter (fun fact: Dijkstra's algorithm isn't as difficult as you think)

Currently, I'm working on this repo if you see this repo empty then probably I'm learning these topics myself.
